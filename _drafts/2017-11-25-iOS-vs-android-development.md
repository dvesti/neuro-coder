Java sucks
Kotlin rocks - lot of copying from swift

I love clear xml positioning and constraints in android. And often clearer hard coded values, rather than visual interface of Xcode

## what I love about android
kotli
just copy paste apps
full device availibility - you can just play around with the files

## what I hate about andorid
Java if you still use it
Stupid naming


## what I love about iOS
simple overriding
storyboard and segues are somewhat clearer in the visual domain, than android's intents. 
swift is neat

## what I hate about iOS
Xcode - being only available on macOS - i understand that it helps with the virtualisation, but it just sucks
Xcode - is slow!
Can't simply play with the device
