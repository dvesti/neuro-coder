Process of regenerating terrain


1. Terrain is passed by reference. So if you modify one, its gonna mess with your other terrains.

2. Removing Trees
3. 3. Removing detail
A bit more tricky. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TerrainData.SetDetailLayer.html
Details are actually saved as a matrix of width*height proportions. SO we need to set it with generating an empty matrix.
