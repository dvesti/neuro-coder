I am in my second year studying neurosciences at Charles University in the Czech Republic. I work mainly on spatial navigation, with some work done in human memory and perception. I started this blog to share some of my work and personal projects related to use of programming in neurosciences and cognitive sciences in general. 

Beside my scientific career (or lack of) I also teach psychology at high school and I am an avid gamer - board and video games. So I expect some of my articles being directed in that way as well :)

Coding is the future of science. With brains. And games. So I guess I am in the right field :)
